# California Fire Analysis

This project analyzes fire incidents in California, focusing on the burned acres across different counties over time. Utilizing datasets on fire incidents, this Jupyter Notebook provides analysis through visualizations and machine learning models to identify patterns and predict future fire impacts.

## Project Overview

__The analysis covers:__

- The total acres burned in California by year.
- A comparison of acres burned across counties.
- A comparison of the percentage burned across counties.
- The top 10 counties affected by wildfires.
- Predictive modeling to forecast acres burned based on historical data.


## Features

- __Data Processing:__ Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- __Visualization:__ Interactive charts and maps showing the distribution and severity of fire incidents.
- __Predictive Modeling:__ A Random Forest model to predict acres burned based on county data.
- __Interactive Elements:__ Widgets for dynamic data exploration.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Plotly for interactive graphs
- GeoPandas for geographical data analysis
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Ipywidgets for interactive widgets
